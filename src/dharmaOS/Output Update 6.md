# Update 16
I want to give everybody a proper update about making progress despite lackluster and frustrating health. The process is everything, right? It seems like creativity, in my case, comes hand in hand with suffering. It is likely that my mind is being taxed to the maximum, living on the bleeding edge, where the technology is evolving so fast that even people trying to keep up every day working on directly contributing will have a hard time to keep up, on a daily basis.. 

What I believe is within grasp is a truly self-evolving system that features an adaptable, that perhaps will even come to be a new class of applications that are infused with AI and human intelligence and enable a new kind of collaboration such as never before, through a customizable and expandable user experience, deeply integrated with AI agents. And that the capabilities and personalities of such agents will each be affected, controlled, and distributed by its own community through a DAO. interface and through their intelligence and even personality through human interactions. What is particularly important in this case is allowing a Human Community to also become part of this evolutionary process of the underlying technology..

Powerful technology should be guided by the desires of many in a trust network.

AI agents propagating and evolving according to the needs of the community and a process designed for communal growth which facilitates organic human connection-centric co-evolution along these universal agents.
