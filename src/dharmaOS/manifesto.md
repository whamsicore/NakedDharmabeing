# Dharma Manifesto
- Value: "Fun is more important than speed, and speed more than scalability!"
- Motto: "Intelligence Everywhere."
- Strategy: 
  - The application itself should take on an identity, to become in many ways, its own master of evolution. This begins with self-awareness...
- Belief: "True growth begins with self-awareness, therefore self-awareness is key."
