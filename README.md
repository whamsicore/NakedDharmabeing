# The Mission üåà
Our mission is to create... Enlightened technology, that spreads beneficence, powered by AI, via a human/connection centric DAO.

Welcome, wonderful sentient being, to the mothership, the Codebase! 

This isn't your average README; it's a portal to the future. 

## DharmaBot: Your Enlightened Assistant üßò
This isn't just any DAO; it's a DAO that propagates, spreading wisdom and enlightenment across the cosmos. Imagine a universe where each DAO is a Powered by its own Intelligent Assistant, That serves its community so that it may flourish and create new communities to spread this tech.

These Dharmabots will grow, learn, and evolve with their respective communities... They're not just tools; they're companions on a journey towards a more enlightened future.

So, buckle up, cosmic travelers! You're not just joining a platform; you're becoming part of a living, breathing ecosystem of light. Welcome to the Dharmaverse.

## DharmaDAO: The Enlightened Collective üïâÔ∏è

The Dharma DAO is the epicenter of innovation, where collective visionaries guide the Dharma Bot towards a universally beneficial path. Key characteristics include:

- ** PTOGE governed Tokenomics:** In DharmaDAOs the token supply directly in the hands of the people. Thus both expansion and contraction of the total coin supply will be built in. Tokenomics will automatically reward both participation and educational efforts.
- **Custom Dharmabots for Automation:** Armed with custom bots designed for efficiency, these entities can automate tasks, tailored through RAG-assisted learning and fine-tuning via LLM and foundational model-based methods.
- **Autonomous Evolution:** Inherently vital, the DAOs have the capability to bud off, creating alternate versions of themselves. These offshoots can evolve independently, becoming autonomous entities in their own right, furthering the spread of enlightenment and technological advancement.

## Features That Spark Joy ‚ú®
- **Super Tool.:** Engage in personal growth activities that not only benefit you but also earn rewards for the community, creating a virtuous cycle of individual and collective enlightenment.
- **Community-Driven:** Super technology Created, maintained, and kept safe by it's own community.
- **Automate Everything:** The Dharmabot is designed to have universal capabilities. Centered around community and intelligent solutions.

## The Real Mission
It's just all about love and fun.
