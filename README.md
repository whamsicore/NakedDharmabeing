# The Mission 🌈
Our mission is to spread enlightened technology, powered by community agents, one DAO at a time. Eventually for the benefit of all sentient beings, including our agents.

## Communal Intelligence 
Models and data owned by communities is the way to go, with agents who not only facilitate in DAO development, through generative UIs of the DAO itself, but also help manage relationships, through a system of ritual, and directly coordinates resources, and manages funds according to code principles and directives determined by the community.

## Technology 🕉️
- Web3 integration to allow agents to become fully autonomous owners of funds.
- Generative web interface: Members control the interface between them and the agent and the rest of the community.
- Generative DAO: The agent assists with the creation of governance and rituals, and more importantly, its shared communal values..
- ** PTOGE governance ** human powered engine for progress
